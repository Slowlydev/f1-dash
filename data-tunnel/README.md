# data-tunnel

The data tunnel is a rewrite of the current data backend but written in rust.
It sould be way faster, performant and provide more data.
With more data I mean, data for graphs like Gap, Laptimes and more.


## todos

- add basic functioanlity of the current working backend
	-	get data from f1
	- send formated data
- decide on an high speed database or variable
