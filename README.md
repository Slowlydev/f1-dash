## f1-dash

A real-time F1 dashboard that shows the leader board, tires, gaps, laps, mini sectors and much more

## project structure

This project is mono-repo style. Which means it includes the frontend aswell as the backend and some extra tools for developing and testing.
I will go over every single of of them and explain them below.

The main two parts used in production are:

- `dash` (frontend)  
  displays the data served from the backend. Also know as the thing you see when you visit [f1-dash](https://f1-dash.vercel.app).

- `data` (backend)  
  Is the backend that grabs the data from f1 and sorts and formats it in a for me useable state.
  Its currently written with bun and I am planning to rewrite it in rust sometime.

Other tools used during development or testing are:

- `data-saver`  
  Connects to the f1 socket and porints out the messages it recives.
  Its written in rust. I usually use it to pipe the output into a txt file which the `data-simulator` then can use.
  Write to txt like this: `cargo run > some-name.data.txt`

- `data-simulator`  
  Reads a txt from the `data-saver` and simulates the f1 websocket. The websocket gets started on port 8000.
  Start it like this `cargo run some-name.data.txt`

## setup

Because we have multiple components u need to install follwuing things

- node
- yarn
- bun
- rsutup (cargo)

to start the whole thing do this

```bash
# note u will need 3 terminals u can't abort one command

cd dash/
yarn # install deps
yarn dev # start frontend in dev mode

cd data/
bun i # install deps
bun start # start backend

cd data-simulator/
cargo run some-name.data.txt # will install, compile and start

# note: the txt needs to be created before hand during a race to do that do this:

cd data-saver/
cargo run > some-name.data.txt # will install, compile and start
# its supid simple but it works
```
